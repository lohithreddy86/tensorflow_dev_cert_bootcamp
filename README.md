## How to Generate Nbdev docs

The below steps helps to generate the documentation of the learning as
webpage and the same can be accessed through GIT for future refernces

Once the ML project template is created through cookiecutter

1.  Rename the notebooks folder to nbs

2.  Then run command “nbdev_new” in terminal

    nbdev_new =\> This command would generate the necessary files within
    the project repository folder required for the - module build
    purposes and for documentation.

3.  for document only repository - like practise or learning projects
    refer - https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/docs_only.html

    run below commands rm setup.py .github/workflows/test.yaml
    nbs/00_core.ipynb

    Remove your library folder (this will be the lib_path field in
    settings.ini)

4.  Then run command “nbdev_docs” in terminal

    This command will generate html pages for all the jupyter notebooks.

         https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/quarto.html#nbdev_docs

5.  push the changes to git repository

6.  Access webpage pertaining to a specific jupyter note book with
    github pages link appended with html page generated for the
    notebook. which can be checked in \_docs folder in the repository.

    for the html generated for the notebook
    “tensorflow_dev_cert_bootcamp/nbs/1_DL_and_TF_Fundamentals.ipynb”
    the \_docs folder has html page “\_docs/dl_and_tf_fundamentals.html”
    Hence we need to append “dl_and_tf_fundamentals” to the existing
    github repo pages which is
    “https://lohithreddy86.github.io/tensorflow_dev_cert_bootcamp/” as
    below.
